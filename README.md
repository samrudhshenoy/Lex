Lex Library Manager



About:

Hello, my name is Samrudh Shenoy. Lex is a project I had been working on and finished in my freshman year, 
and it serves as a library database manager. Lex is a locally run school library database manager, with 
the basic functions of storing, adding, and editing members/teachers and books. In addition to basic tasks, 
the user has the ability to file multiple types of reports with a vast array of information, and execute 
actions such as editing and managing members' fines, book limits, time limits, and more! After consulting 
the Homestead High School librarian (Amity Bateman), as well as the branch manager of the San Mateo County 
Libraries (Garrett Kuramoto), I received feedback, and gained the approval to use my program within school 
classrooms, with teachers managing small libraries and book collections.

This program has two main versions, the difference being a change between a 
white-blue theme, and a green-black theme, both of which are found in this linked GitHub repository.

The original product will be found in the folder LexLibraryManager, and the modified product (with the
green-black theme) will be found in the LosAltosHacks folder (I had made CSS modifications to the project's
theme during a hackathon).

Functionality:

The program tracks library books and borrowers(students or teachers) that are in a school. Every member has
their own information recorded for first name, last name, status(student or teacher), books checked out, book 
limit, time limit, fine owed.

The program is able to export reports as xml files, as well as print them.
A master report can be created to track the issuance of books for all members, and provides all the information. 
The report can be printed or exported as an excel .xls file to the desktop for convenience.
