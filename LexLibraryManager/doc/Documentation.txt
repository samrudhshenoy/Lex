Functionality
————————
The program tracks library books and borrowers(students or teachers) that are in a school. Every member has
their own information recorded for first name, last name, status(student or teacher), books checked out, book 
limit, time limit, fine owed.

The program is able to export reports as xml files, as well as print them.
A master report can be created to track the issuance of books for all members, and provides all the information. 
The report can be printed or exported as an excel .xls file to the desktop for convenience.
